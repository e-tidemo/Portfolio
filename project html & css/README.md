(view live website here)

Cycle Gothenburg is a website for a fictional business that aims to build a community for long-distance cyclists in and around Gothenburg and to encourage more to take up cycling. The target audience for the website is people who are just starting out with long-distance cycling, those who are interested in getting started and for those who have more experience but are looking for a group of people to ride with. Through the website one can simply sign up to group rides and get a time, a place and a route for the ride.

    - **Additional links to sign up**

      - The form also includes a checkbox at the end where the user can choose to sign up to get an email regularly for the chosen kind of group ride. If the user just wants to join one ride they can simply not check the box.
      - The sign up page also has a map to where the group rides always start.
